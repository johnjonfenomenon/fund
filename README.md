# fund

This strapi fund app creates a funds, investors and bals content type.  I then proceeded to insert some intital data
I have created a test framework modeled after https://strapi.io/documentation/1.x.x/testing.html
Before running npm test you will need to  
                                      - npm install co-supertest
                                      - npm install supertest
                                      - npm install chai
                                      
There are a total of 6 small tests that are implemented in investor.test.js
